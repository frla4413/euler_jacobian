o It is shown how to compute an exact explicit Jacobian for numerical approximations of initial boundary value problems

o The Jacobian of a numerical discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations is derived, as an example.

o Newton's method is used to solve the corresponding nonlinear system of equations, employing the new technique.

o The additional cost of evaluating the Jacobian is small.

o The correct implementation of the Jacobian and the numerical discretization are verified by numerical experiments.

o This new technique can be used on any numerical approximations of initial boundary value problems on matrix-vector form.
