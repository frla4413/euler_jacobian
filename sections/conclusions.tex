\section{Summary and conclusions}
We derived an explicit expression for the Jacobian of the discretization of the incompressible Euler equations. Due to the use of encapsulated difference operators, the extension to a curved grid is straight forward. Different boundary conditions such as the solid wall, the Dirichlet inflow and pressure outflow conditions have been used and the Jacobian for all these sets of boundary conditions were also presented. Lastly, the numerical method has been illustrated for different cases and also verified by the method of manufactured solutions.
