We derive the Jacobian for a finite difference discretization of the incompressible Euler equations in two dimensions. By using encapsulated difference operators it is straight forward to explicitly obtain the Jacobian also for curved grids. Different sets of boundary conditions are imposed and the corresponding parts of the Jacobian are derived. The numerical scheme is verified by a manufactured solution.
